				<h1>WE CAME,WE SAW,WE CONQUERED</h1>
				<p>
					Conquest Brewing Company is the embodiment of an idea. The idea that beer should be more than a beverage, more than an alcohol delivery system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our beers pay homage to bygone times of war and peace, to tales both fantastic and dreadfully real. We believe that the onward march of history will show that in the end, honor is what makes a man, and taste is what makes a beerâ€“ not marketing, not hype. Taste. And we do not intend to be lost to the annals of history.
